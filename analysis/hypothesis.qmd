## Primary Hypothesis

We hypothesize that:

- **H1:** Higher levels of procrastination are associated with:
  - Increased risk of transitioning from Normal Cognition to MCI $(\beta = x, p < .05)$
  - Increased risk of transitioning from MCI to Dementia $(\beta = y, p < .05)$
  
- **H0:** There is no association between procrastination and cognitive decline transitions


In order to test this hypothesis we will be using a **discrete time Markov Model**

## Abstract

Cognitive decline is a global health concern, making the identification
of early, modifiable risk factors essential. While apathy is a
recognized prodromal marker, procrastination may also signal early
executive dysfunction. We used longitudinal secondary data from the
United States Health and Retirement Study among adults aged 60+
$(n = 549; \bar{x} = 69.70;\sigma = 7.58)$. Cognitive function,
procrastination, and a proxy measure of apathy were assessed.
Transitions between normative cognitive function, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), and dementia were modeled using a discrete-time
first-order Markov model. Procrastination scores were higher among
individuals with MCI or dementia than those with normative cognitive
function. Procrastination also interacted with age, disproportionately
increasing the risk of decline in the oldest participants.
Procrastination was associated with cognitive impairment and predicted
transitions to MCI, suggesting it may serve as both an early behavioral
marker and compounding risk factor.

## 🥔🐚: Note on “crisp clam” project name

Because project titles change all the time we used
[{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)

codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31 ucrt).

codename(seed = "dementia", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "crisp clam"
```
